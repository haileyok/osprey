// The following are protos for TakeData operations for Osprey data services.
// Please note that these are redefined in each service file. This is because
// prost/pigeon-build were not properly generating the `osprey.rpc.commom.v1.rs`
// file, causing the objects to not be visible. I spent an *unholy* amount of time
// trying to fix this tooling issue and decided it was not worth the effort.
//
// I'm leaving the protos here and comments in the respective build.rs files
// for a later date when someone (probably myself) wants to revisit this in the future.
