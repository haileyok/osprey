    An abstract class used to define custom extracted features, which can be serialized to JSON.

    Custom extracted features are used to add additional information to the `ExecutionResult.extracted_features` dict.

    When added to the `ExecutionResult.extracted_features`, the `feature_name` will have a double underscore appended to it.
    This is to avoid conflicts with base extracted features (variables).
